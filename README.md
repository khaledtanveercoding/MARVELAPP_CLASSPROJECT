Assignment for class. Uses the MARVEL API.

run : $ npm create vite@latest select React - Javascript npm npm run dev npm install sass npm install md5

API CODES were given in a .env.local file. Please place that file in the root folder for this project. 

The site loads slowly, I assume it's because of the calls made to the MARVEL API, but I could be wrong. I'm open to suggestions to make this run faster.

This app hits the API twice, one for character details and images, and then another for specific comics by that character. For example, typing "Storm" will give you variations of the character Storm, and then "View Comics" will render comic details. Both of these calls take time, so please wait.
